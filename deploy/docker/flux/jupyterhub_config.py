#  An active server is any server that's not fully stopped. It is considered
#  active from the time it has been requested until the time that it has
#  completely stopped.
#  
#  If this many user servers are active, users will not be able to launch new
#  servers until a server is shutdown. Spawn requests will be rejected with a 429
